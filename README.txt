Challenges: I had trouble figuring out how to change the string coming in from client to piratespeak

Step1,2 and 3 work perfectly but I wasn’t able to figure out how to change the string back to normal and my server prints out the where de yo go? 
Message only if the server is closed using ctrl C and it doesn’t work the other way.
